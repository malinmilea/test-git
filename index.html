            <article>
                <p> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
                    language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                    JavaScript.</p>
                <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
                    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
                    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
                    structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
                    between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
                <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
                    different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                    speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
                    alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
            <header>Selector</header>
            <article>
                <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes
                    in the markup itself.</p>
                <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
                    <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:<ul>
                            <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, identified with a hash prefix e.g. #id
                            </li>
                            <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document, identified with
                                a period prefix e.g. <code>.classname</code> </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters,
                    hyphens, and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may
                    only be applied to a single element.</p>

                <p> Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not
                    contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code
                        style="color:blue;">:hover</code>, which
                    identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse
                    cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in<code style="color:blue;"> a:hover </code>or <code
                        style="color:blue;">#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class
                    classifies document elements, such as<code style="color:blue;">:link</code> or <code
                        style="color:blue;">:visited</code>, whereas a
                    pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such
                    as<code style="color:blue;"> ::first-line</code> or <code style="color:blue;">::first-letter</code>
                </p>

                <header>Declaration block</header>
                <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of
                    a property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon
                    (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last (or single)
                    declaration may be used.</p>
                <p>Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some
                    properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.
                </p>
                <p>Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as
                    <code>200px</code>(200
                    pixels), <code>50vw</code> (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent
                    element's width).
                    Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. <code>"red"</code>), hexadecimal values (e.g.
                    <code>#FF0000</code>, also
                    abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. <code>rgb(255, 0, 0)</code>), RGBA values
                    that specify
                    both color and alpha transparency (e.g. <code>rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)</code>), or HSL or HSLA values
                    (e.g. <code>hsl(000,
                    100%, 50%)</code>, <code>hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)</code>).

            <section class="main-section" id="Length_units">
                <header>Length units</header>
                <p>Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a length unit, which is either an
                    alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in <code>200px</code> or <code>50vw</code>; or a percentage
                    sign, as in <code>80%</code>. Some units –
                    <code>cm</code> (<span style="color:blue">centimetre</span>); <code>in </code>(<span
                        style="color:blue">inch</span>); <code>mm</code> (<span style="color:blue">millimetre</span>);
                    <code>pc</code>
                    (<span style="color:blue">pica</span>); and <code>pt</code> (<span style="color:blue">point</span>)
                    – are <span style="font-weight:bold;">absolute</span>, which means
                    that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others – <code>em</code>
                    (<span style="color:blue">em</span>); <code>>ex</code>
                    (<span style="color:blue">ex</span>) and <code>px</code>(<span style="color:blue">pixel</span>) –
                    are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent
                    element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of CSS 1 and
                    retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, if
                    adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units:<code>ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and
                    vw</code>.

                <p>
                    Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML
                    markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be
                    explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that
                    information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, headings (<code>h1</code> elements), sub-headings (<code>h2</code>), sub-sub-headings
                    (<code>h3</code>), etc.,
                    are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and
                    emphasis for these elements is <italic>presentational</italic>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all
                    <code>h2</code>
                    headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This
                    made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the
                    separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size,
                    borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for
                    on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis
                    for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.
                </p>

                    <code><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="nt">font</span> <span class="na">color</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"red"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Chapter 1.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">font</span><span class="p">&gt;&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Using CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational
                    attributes:
                </p>
                <p><code><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="na">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"color: red;"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Chapter 1.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
 </pre></code></p>
                <p>The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when
                    the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file.
                    For example, suppose the document contains the style element:</p>
                <p><code><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">style</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
                    <span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                        <span class="k">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">blue</span><span class="p">;</span>
                    <span class="p">}</span>
                <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">style</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
                </pre></code></p>
                <p>rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual
                    <code>h1</code> element.
                </p>
                <p>The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax
                    similar to:</p>
                <p><code><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">link</span> <span class="na">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"path/to/file.css"</span> <span class="na">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">"text/css"</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
                </pre></code></p>
                <p>This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it possible to restyle multiple
                    documents by simply editing a shared external CSS file.
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Sources">
                <header>Sources </header>
                <p>CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user
                    and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type,
                    importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style
                    information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple
                    style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being
                    used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that
                    authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.</p>
                <p>The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the
                    highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style.
                    The process is called <italic>cascading.</italic>
                </p>
                <p>One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red
                    italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and
                    the web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove
                    all added styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red
                    italic heading style without altering other attributes.</p>

                <p>
                    <italic>Specificity</italic> refers to the relative weights of various rules. It determines which
                    styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple
                    selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID
                    selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal
                    system, commas are used to separate the "digits" (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would
                    have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).
                </p>
